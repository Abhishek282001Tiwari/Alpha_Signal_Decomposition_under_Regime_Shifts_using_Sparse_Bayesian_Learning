# Alpha Signal Decomposition
## Regime-Conditional Sparse Bayesian Learning for Financial Markets

A sophisticated quantitative finance system that decomposes alpha signals into regime-dependent components using advanced Bayesian machine learning techniques.

## System Overview

This institutional-grade platform combines cutting-edge machine learning with robust financial engineering to create a comprehensive alpha generation and portfolio optimization system.

### Key Innovations

- **Advanced Risk Management**: Multi-database support with comprehensive factor models
- **Real-Time Processing**: Production-ready data streaming with technical indicators

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Sparse Bayesian Learning Engine**: 1,300+ lines of advanced mathematical implementation
- **Regime Detection**: Multiple methods (HMM, MS-VAR, GMM) with ensemble weighting
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Mean-Variance, Black-Litterman, Risk Parity, and robust methods
- **Risk Management**: Comprehensive factor models with regime-aware adjustments

### Technical Features

- **100+ Engineered Features**: Technical, fundamental, macro, and cross-sectional signals
- **Multi-Database Support**: SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL compatibility
- **Container-Ready**: Docker and Kubernetes deployment configurations
- **Monitoring & Analytics**: Prometheus metrics with bootstrap confidence intervals

## Quick Start

```python
from src.regime_conditional_sbl import RegimeConditionalSBL
from src.data.collectors import MarketDataCollector
from src.regime_detection import RegimeDetector

# Initialize system
regime_detector = RegimeDetector()
sbl_model = RegimeConditionalSBL(n_regimes=3)
data_collector = MarketDataCollector()

# Load and process data
market_data = data_collector.get_market_data(['AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT'])
regimes = regime_detector.detect_regimes(market_data)

# Train regime-conditional model
sbl_model.fit(market_data, regimes)

# Generate predictions
alpha_signals = sbl_model.predict(new_data)
```
